# RevTranslationEditor
## Brief description:
A java-based tool to simplify the ENG-KOR translation process of video transcription scripts given by Rev. Utilizes the Google Translate API to translate the existing text on the text area.

## Background:
* Translating from scratch is less time efficient compared to editing a text that has been put through a translation technology such as Google Translate.
* Rev provides subtitle translators with transcription files in SRT format. When copied and pasted in a text editing tool, the text includes unnecessary enters that break sentences and therefore affect the result of Google Translate.

## What does this tool do?
* Removes the extra enters in the text
* Provides the user the option to group the lines so that each paragraph consists 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 sentences.
* Users can translate everything in the text area at once with a click of a button. 

The translated version of each paragraph will appear right underneath it. Users can then edit the Google-Translated text so that it sounds more fluent. The paragraph in the original langauge (English) is kept so that the user can easily refer back to what the paragraph is about.
